    <h3>Simple Linear Regression</h3>
    <p> Linear regression is a fundamental statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent 
        variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a straight line to the observed data points. 
        The goal of linear regression is to find the best-fitting line that minimizes the difference between the 
        observed values and the values predicted by the model. This technique is widely used in various fields, 
        including economics, finance, engineering, and social sciences, to analyze and predict trends, understand 
        correlations, and make forecasts. In essence, linear regression provides insights into how changes in one or 
        more independent variables affect the dependent variable, making it a powerful tool for understanding and 
        interpreting data relationships.</p>

    <h3>Multiple Linear Regression</h3>
    <p> Multiple linear regression expands upon the concept of linear regression by allowing for the analysis of 
        relationships between a dependent variable and two or more independent variables. Instead of fitting a 
        single line, multiple linear regression fits a plane or hyperplane to the data, capturing the combined 
        influence of multiple predictors on the target variable. This technique is valuable for understanding 
        complex relationships in data where the outcome is influenced by multiple factors simultaneously. 
        Multiple linear regression is extensively used in various fields, including economics, marketing, and 
        social sciences, to explore how different variables interact and to make predictions based on multiple 
        predictors. By incorporating multiple independent variables, this method provides a more nuanced 
        understanding of the relationships within the data, enabling better-informed decision-making and prediction.</p>

    <h3>Logistic Regression</h3>
    <p> Logistic regression is a statistical method used for binary classification tasks, where the outcome 
        variable is categorical and has two possible values, such as yes/no, true/false, or 0/1. Unlike linear 
        regression, which predicts continuous values, logistic regression predicts the probability that an 
        observation belongs to a particular category. It does so by applying the logistic function to a linear 
        combination of predictor variables, resulting in an S-shaped curve that maps inputs to probabilities. 
        This technique is widely employed in various fields, including medicine, finance, and marketing, for 
        tasks such as predicting the likelihood of a patient having a disease, determining the probability of 
        default on a loan, or classifying emails as spam or not spam. Logistic regression is valued for its 
        simplicity, interpretability, and effectiveness in modeling binary outcomes, making it a staple in 
        the toolkit of data scientists and analysts for classification tasks.</p>

    <h3>ARIMA Model</h3>
    <p> The ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model is a popular method for analyzing and 
        forecasting time series data. It combines three key components: autoregression (AR), differencing 
        (I), and moving averages (MA). The autoregressive component captures the relationship between an 
        observation and a number of lagged observations, representing the effect of past values on the 
        current value. The differencing component deals with non-stationarity by transforming the series 
        into a stationary one, often by taking differences between consecutive observations. Finally, the 
        moving average component accounts for the impact of random fluctuations in the series. By incorporating 
        these components, the ARIMA model can effectively capture and predict patterns in time series data, 
        making it a valuable tool for tasks such as forecasting stock prices, analyzing economic indicators, 
        and predicting seasonal trends.</p>
